A small SCRUM team of 5 members, 4 days into the sprint.

---

#### Person 1

Got conflicts merging in from develop. Found out the thing they'd worked on yesterday was already done by Person 3 on Monday. Person 1 was on Person 3's PR, and approved it on Monday. Person 1 was also present at stand up on Monday where Person 3 outlined the job they was going to do.

#### Person 2

Went to start his task for the day, at 1:40pm, and found that Person 1 was already working on it, even though his assigned task was different. Person 2 was instructed to work on the bug list, but it would be good to revisit that task later to improve the usability. Person 2 closed the task.

#### Person 3

Spent the day trying to resolve a bug in production that could not be reproduced in any other environment. Ended up discovering that whilst the code had calls to a logging interface, those calls didn't actually go to a logging library. They did go to an exception handling library, but it threw an exception whenever anyone tried to view the error detail. A hotfix release was created to make the logging methods call the logger, and once that was deployed, the bug was no longer reproducible.

#### Person 4

Spent the day working on a task unrelated to the current sprint goal.

#### Person 5

Is on sick leave, though did optimistically turn up at stand up and babble incoherently for a few minutes.
